# TicTacToe
Functional "Tic-Tac-Toe" Pet Project

This project is a simple recreation of the renowned "Tic-Tac-Toe" game. I have developed this game in order to put what I have learned as a programmer into practice. Although it is complete as a simple TicTacToe game, I would like to add animations and different game modes in order to make this project truly different!

The project is a personal exercise on:
  -Clean coding principles
  -Polymorphism and Class Architeture
  -Java Swing and other GUI software
  -App Design
  -Model, View, Controller (MVC)
  -JUnit Testing
  -and other concepts!

Characteristics:
  +The Java Project is outfitted with model, view, and controller classes where the model can run independently of the other two
  +Designed using an event driven architecture making use of 'switch' statements in order to navigate between events (State architecture      can be seen in 'resources/willBeAddedSoon.jpg')
  +GUI will be added soon
  +Contains images of design drawings and state architecture
  +Proper JUnit testing and Javadoc documentation for all classes and methods
  
Any comments (compliments, critique, etc.) on this are appreciated! Programming is something to master; awareness of what I am doing right and wrong is what will push me towards better understanding.
